# asynchExpress

Simple Node/Express app to demonstrate calling an asyncronous function (like a http get or db lookup) in an express middleware function and setting a returned value in the request object so that all routes will have access to it.

## Other cool stuff

1. Uses ES6 via Babel
2. Uses Flow for type checking
3. Uses Jest for tests (even snapshot tests a JSON return value)
4. Uses Eslint

Let me know if you dig it :-)
